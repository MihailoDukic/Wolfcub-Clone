## Project Description

Wolfcub is a digital strategic agency located in the UK. I felt in love with their website design and minimalistic features and decided to recreate most of their website and add my own twist to it. I have used wolfcubs images, text and layouts for project purposes and not for commercial use. The original site can be found at https://wolfcubdigital.co.uk/

## The Process 
Firstly, I setup my development enviroment with Parcel bundler and gathered all the images and approximate sizes for fonts using SCSS mixins and custom variables. I chose a desktop first approach and recreated all the content. The project took me approximately 5 days to complete. There are still features I would like too add to make it function better. 


## Technologies Used

HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, Javascript, GSAP, Glide slider , Parcel bundler
